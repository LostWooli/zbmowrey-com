# zbmowrey-com

This is the code behind [my website](https://zbmowrey.com). It's a Vue 2 SPA hosted as HTML,
CSS, and Javascript on s3 behind CloudFront; this keeps my hosting costs near zero. Feel free
to poke around in .github/workflows, where I showcase Github Actions for automated deployment
and Terraform to build out infrastructure. 

If you see something I could improve, please point it out. I'm always happy to learn something new!
